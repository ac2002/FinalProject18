# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018



My game is a basic text based rpg. In it, the user can do everything besides physically fight the respective enemies, in the sense
that they can buy their own items, choose the room that they enter, and choose the boss that they fight. Essentially, they play through the
game, guided by the text, and fight a total of 7 different enemies, each with varying difficulty levels. I have 15 total bots, 5 easy, 5 medium, 5 hard, and
the user fights a random assortment of 7 of them, of which all are different. They can then choose to drink their health potions, which will
buff their health, and afterwards they will go to the shop. I made the shop particularly stingy so that if you mistype you get booted, only
because it was fun I was considering letting them buy again but that wouldn't be as interesting. If the user survives 7 rounds they get
to choose a boss round to fight which is not known to the user. The three bosses have distinct traits to each of them. For example, Dracula leeches health from the user
after they attack each other, Geico lizard destroys all of the user's defense and has like 90 dodge, and magneto steals all of the user's positive
items. If the user wins, they then have to answer none other than a history question to win the game for good. I made it pretty easy to win but I
also did do some character nerfing afterwards and idk how its gonna go now. Its really up to how the user plays.
